PulseCheck
============================

PulseCheck is a simple program written to ping a list of urls and notify an administrator when
something has gone wrong. PulseCheck simply examines a HTTP response from the URL and logs an
error when the response is anything besides 200.

Requirements
- Ruby 1.8+
- Actionmailer gem

Usage 
============================
- Open config.txt and under mail_recipients, add each email address which will receive an alert 
when a website is no longer returning a 200 response code

- Under check_urls, add each url you would like to monitor

That's it. If you want this script to run continuously, assign it to cron or daemon.

To execute, from prompt:
$ ruby check
